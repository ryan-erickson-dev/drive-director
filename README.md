# 🚗 drive-director
## 🗒️ Summary
Drive Director is a designated driver route planner that accommodates incoming requests for rides and incorporates them into driver routes. 
With the front-end written in React and back-end server requests handled by Flask, this web app is meant to be deployed to small, self-led groups looking to optimize their driver systems.

We come from organizations that are disorganized, jumbled, and run on the train of thought alone. We were inspired to make Drive Director after experiencing first-hand just how chaotic a designated driver system can be. While apps like Uber and Lyft depend on a transactional system, we're working to support those that depend on service - making lives easier. 

## ⚙️ Setup
```sh
# Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:ryan-erickson-dev/drive-director.git;

# Enter the repo's front-end directory
cd drive-director/front-end;

# Install all front-end node modules
npm i;

cd ../
```
